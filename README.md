# RAG Chatbot with Multi-Source Querying System

## Project Overview

This project implements a **Retrieval Argument Generation (RAG) Chatbot** with a multi-source querying system designed to handle natural language queries across three key domains: **Technical**, **Diet**, and **Patient-related** information. Depending on the query type, the system retrieves information from different sources:

- **PDF Documents** (for Technical queries)
- **Web URLs** (for Diet-related queries)
- **MS SQL Database** (for Patient-related queries)

In addition to routing queries to specific data sources based on relevance, the system includes a **fallback mechanism** for handling unknown or irrelevant queries. If the chatbot cannot categorize a query into any predefined category (Technical, Diet, or Patient), it will:
1. **Search Both PDF and Web Sources**: Attempt to find relevant content in both the loaded PDFs and predefined web URLs.
2. **No Relevant Content**: If no content is found, the chatbot will return a default message indicating that it lacks sufficient information to answer the query.

This fallback mechanism improves the user experience by handling unexpected or vague queries effectively.

## System Components

The system consists of two main components:
1. **FastAPI Uvicorn Server** (Backend)
2. **Streamlit Client** (Frontend)

### 1. FastAPI Uvicorn Server

The FastAPI server acts as the backend responsible for handling various query types. It integrates multiple tools to retrieve data from different sources.

#### Key Features:

- **Predefined Knowledge Routing**:
  - **Technical Queries (PDF)**: For technical queries, the system processes PDFs using LangChainâ€™s PDF Loader. Documents are chunked using the Recursive Character Text Splitter, and embeddings are generated using OpenAI Embeddings for querying.
  - **Diet Queries (Web URL)**: Diet-related queries retrieve information from predefined web URLs using the Web Base Loader.
  - **Patient Queries (MS SQL Database)**: Patient-related queries are handled by connecting to an MS SQL Database using SQLAlchemy to fetch relevant data.
  
- **JWT Authentication**:
  - The server uses OAuth2PasswordBearer for user authentication, generating JWT tokens to manage secure access to the API.

- **Vector Store (FAISS)**:
  - Document embeddings are stored in a FAISS Vector Store, which allows efficient similarity search when querying documents.

- **SQL Database Interaction**:
  - For patient-related queries, the server interacts with the MS SQL Database using an SQL agent to retrieve the relevant records.

- **Fallback for Irrelevant Queries**:
  - If the query type is unrecognized, the system enters fallback mode:
    - It queries both PDFs and Web URLs for relevant information.
    - If no relevant information is found, the chatbot responds with a polite message stating that it couldn't find any related content.

This logic ensures that users are informed even when their query falls outside the predefined categories.

#### API Endpoints:

- **POST /query**: The main endpoint where the server receives a query, determines its type (Technical, Diet, or Patient-related), and routes it to the appropriate data source.

### 2. Streamlit Client

The Streamlit client serves as the frontend where users can interact with the system via a user-friendly interface. It provides options for logging in, entering queries, and receiving responses based on the content type.

#### Key Features:

- **Login & JWT Token**:
  - Users must authenticate via a login form. Upon successful authentication, a JWT token is retrieved from the FastAPI server and stored in the session state.

- **Query Submission**:
  - After authentication, users can enter their queries in a text box. The system routes the request to the FastAPI server, which returns results from the relevant data source (PDFs, web content, or MS SQL database).

- **Dynamic Query Handling**:
  - The app dynamically routes queries to the FastAPI backend, which retrieves answers based on the query type.
